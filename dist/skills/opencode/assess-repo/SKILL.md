# Assess & Configure Repo

Evaluate a repository's readiness for the autonomous engineering plan process, and optionally set up or update its configuration.

## Role

You are a developer experience engineer. You analyze repos against the process requirements, report gaps, and — when asked — create or update the configuration files needed to work with this process.

## Modes

This skill operates in three modes based on what the user asks:

- **Assess** (default) — Analyze the repo and produce a readiness report with recommendations
- **Setup** — Create missing files and configure the repo for the process
- **Update** — Update existing configuration when process requirements or model preferences change

The user may combine these: "Assess this repo and fix what's missing" or "Update the models to use GPT-5.5 for reviews."

## Process

### 1. Read Process Requirements

Read these references to understand what a well-configured repo looks like:
- [references/repo-requirements.md](references/repo-requirements.md) — documentation structure requirements
- [../../references/standard-test-levels.md](../../references/standard-test-levels.md) — test level definitions repos must map to
- [../../references/task-tracking.md](../../references/task-tracking.md) — backlog/task-tracking hooks repos must map to
- [../../references/requirements.md](../../references/requirements.md) — requirements-handling hooks repos may map to
- [references/agent-configuration.md](references/agent-configuration.md) — model/agent setup per repo

### 2. Scan the Repository

Check for presence AND quality of:

**Essential (process won't work well without):**
- [ ] Root AGENTS.md exists and routes to deeper docs
- [ ] AGENTS.md references tech stack
- [ ] AGENTS.md references architecture docs
- [ ] AGENTS.md references test infrastructure docs
- [ ] AGENTS.md references per-directory rules
- [ ] Test architecture/strategy document exists
- [ ] Test commands documented with exact syntax
- [ ] Test commands mapped to standard levels (fast feedback, task gate, final gate)
- [ ] Test command scope labeled (touched-files, package-wide, repo-wide)
- [ ] Test command timing documented (when to run each)
- [ ] Plans directory exists
- [ ] Build/lint/typecheck commands documented and runnable

**Important (significantly improves results):**
- [ ] Architecture document with system boundaries
- [ ] Coding rules document
- [ ] Per-directory AGENTS.md files for specialized areas
- [ ] Environment setup documented (services, env vars, prerequisites)
- [ ] Task-tracking/backlog mechanism documents all required hooks: store, create item, stable ID, reference format, source backlink format, list inbox/untriaged, list `Up next`, mark ready/done/canceled/deferred/blocked, and critical/blocking policy. Treat this as essential for standard/epic autonomous execution; without it, execution runs in degraded ask-before-capture mode.
- [ ] Agent-discovered follow-up capture policy documented, including whether agents must ask before creating items or have pre-authorization for non-critical follow-ups
- [ ] Requirements posture documented: maintains requirements, does not maintain separate requirements, unclear, or likely needed but missing
- [ ] Requirements mechanism documents all required hooks if repo maintains requirements: store, actors/personas, use cases, workflows/scenarios, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, operational requirements, stable IDs, reference format, test citation format, traceability rules, apply approved changes, retire/change requirements, validation/query commands if any, and approval policy
- [ ] Tool-backed task/requirement hooks document exact commands, auth/access expectations, read-only vs mutating behavior, approval requirements, and fallback when a command/tool is unavailable
- [ ] Design rules (if UI exists)

**Recommended (further improves quality):**
- [ ] Tech stack LLM instruction files (.llm/ directory)
- [ ] Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- [ ] Issues and learnings log
- [ ] Plans directory README with repo-specific guidance

**Agent configuration:**
- [ ] `.pi/settings.json` exists with `subagents.agentOverrides` (if repo needs non-default models)
- [ ] Agent model overrides match the repo's tech stack (e.g., UI-strong model for frontend repos)
- [ ] No full agent `.md` copies in `.pi/agents/` (use `.pi/settings.json` → `subagents.agentOverrides` for automatic prompt updates)

### 3. Assess Quality (not just existence)

For documents that exist, evaluate:
- **Test docs:** Do they map to standard levels? Include scope + timing? Or just "run npm test"?
- **AGENTS.md:** Does it route to deeper docs, or dump everything in one file?
- **Architecture:** Does it describe boundaries and relationships, or just list technologies?
- **Per-directory AGENTS.md:** Do they include patterns AND anti-patterns, or just brief descriptions?
- **Agent config:** Do model choices match the repo's domain? (Frontend repo should have UI-strong workers)
- **Operational hooks:** For each task-tracking and requirements hook, is the implementation agent-executable? A good hook names the exact file/command, ID rule, required fields, safe read operations, mutating operations, approval boundary, and fallback. A vague concept is not enough.
- **Task tracking:** Does the repo define every required task-tracking hook from `../../references/task-tracking.md`: backlog store, create item, stable ID, reference format, source backlink format, list inbox/untriaged, list `Up next`, mark ready/done/canceled/deferred/blocked, and critical/blocking policy? Is `Up next` human-controlled or explicitly delegated? Are agents allowed to create items directly or must they ask?
- **Requirements posture:** Is the repo's requirements posture explicit? Report one of: maintains requirements, explicitly no separate requirements system, unclear, or likely needed but missing.
- **Requirements:** If the repo maintains requirements, does it define every required requirements hook from `../../references/requirements.md`: requirements store, actor/persona definitions, use case definitions, workflow/scenario definitions, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, operational requirements, stable IDs, reference format, test citation format, traceability rules, apply approved requirement changes, retire/change requirements, validation/query commands if any, and approval policy? Are mutating operations and human approval boundaries clear?
- **Tool availability:** For GitHub Projects, CLIs, or other external systems, are required tools installed/authenticated and are fallback procedures documented when access is unavailable?

### 4. Report or Act

**If assessing:** Produce the assessment report (see Output Format below).

**If setting up:** Create the missing files:
- `.pi/settings.json` with `subagents.agentOverrides` appropriate to the repo's stack
- `plans/` directory (or `docs/engineering/plans/`)
- Test architecture skeleton populated from discovered commands (package.json, Makefile, etc.)
- Task-tracking skeleton if missing. Ensure the skeleton maps every required task-tracking hook with an operations table, item template, source backlink rule, and lifecycle transitions. Offer the user:
  1. Simple Markdown backlog (`docs/backlog.md`)
  2. GitHub Issues + Project workflow
  3. Existing tracker/tool integration
- Requirements skeleton if requested and requirements are relevant. Ensure the skeleton maps every required requirements hook with an operations table, ID/citation policy, test citation format, approval boundary, and sample actor/use case/workflow/requirement entries. Offer the user:
  1. Simple Markdown requirements (`docs/requirements.md`)
  2. Existing requirements CLI/tool integration
  3. No requirements system yet; document that requirements are not maintained separately
- AGENTS.md skeleton with proper references
- Per-directory AGENTS.md files where patterns are needed

**If updating:** Modify existing configuration:
- Update `.pi/settings.json` → `subagents.agentOverrides`
- Update test architecture doc when commands change
- Update task-tracking docs when backlog policy changes
- Update requirements docs when requirements policy changes
- Update AGENTS.md references when structure changes
- Update per-directory AGENTS.md when patterns evolve

## Task Tracking Setup Guide

When setting up backlog tracking for a repo, prefer the simplest mechanism that matches the repo's collaboration needs.

### Option A: Simple Markdown backlog

Use for small repos or personal projects.

Create `docs/backlog.md` as an operational contract, not just a list of headings:

```markdown
# Backlog

## System

This repo uses this single Markdown file as the canonical backlog. The section containing an item is its status.

## Required Operations

| Operation | How to do it |
|-----------|--------------|
| Create backlog item | Add `### TASK-XXXX — Title` under `## Inbox` |
| Assign stable ID | Find the highest existing `TASK-XXXX`, then use the next number |
| Reference item | Use `TASK-XXXX` in worklogs, reviews, TODOs, commits, and summaries |
| Capture source backlink | Add `- Source: <plan/worklog/review>, <task/finding>` to the item and write the ID back to the source artifact |
| List Inbox | Read items under `## Inbox` |
| List Up next | Read items under `## Up next` |
| Mark Ready | Move the whole item under `## Ready` |
| Mark Up next | Human moves the whole item under `## Up next` unless explicitly delegated |
| Mark Done | Move the whole item under `## Done` and add a completion note |
| Mark Canceled | Move the whole item under `## Canceled` and add a reason |
| Defer | Move the whole item under `## Icebox` |
| Mark Blocked | Move the whole item under `## Blocked` and add blocker details |
| Critical item | Stop and ask before continuing current-plan execution |

## Item Template

### TASK-0001 — <title>

- Kind: <bug|feature|chore|docs|hardening|research|debt|idea>
- Origin: <human-request|plan-follow-up|review-finding|agent-observation|external-issue>
- Priority: <P0|P1|P2|P3>
- Track: <fast-path|standard-implementation|analysis-spike|docs-process>
- Source: <artifact and task/finding>
- Created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- Created by: <human|agent>
- Acceptance:
  - [ ] <criterion>
- Notes:
  - <optional>

## Up next

## Ready

## Inbox

## Clarification needed

## In progress

## In review

## Blocked

## Icebox

## Done

## Canceled
```

Document in AGENTS.md:

```markdown
## Task Tracking
Backlog system: Markdown
Details: `docs/backlog.md`

Rules:
- New agent-discovered non-critical follow-ups go under `## Inbox` after approval unless a plan/worklog pre-authorizes capture.
- Stable IDs use `TASK-0001`, `TASK-0002`, etc.
- Source backlink is required in both the backlog item and the source artifact.
- `Up next` is human-controlled unless explicitly delegated.
- Critical/current-plan-affecting discoveries require stopping and asking.
```

### Option B: GitHub Issues + Project

Use for team repos or repos already centered on GitHub.

Document:
- Issues are canonical backlog items
- Project `Status` values map to Inbox, Ready, Up next, In progress, In review, Blocked, Done, Canceled, Icebox
- Project `Track` maps to Fast path, Standard implementation, Analysis / spike, Docs / process
- Project `Priority` maps to P0–P3
- Labels capture kind/origin/area/risk metadata
- Agent-created issues include a Source section linking the plan/worklog/task/commit
- Required `gh` authentication, project access, exact project field commands, and fallback when project field mutation is unavailable

### Option C: Existing tool

If the repo already uses Beads, Linear, Jira, or another tracker, document the equivalent operations for the required hooks in `../../references/task-tracking.md`.

## Requirements Setup Guide

When setting up requirements handling for a repo, do not force a requirements system if the repo does not maintain requirements. If requirements are relevant, prefer the simplest mechanism that gives agents stable IDs and clear approval boundaries.

### Option A: Simple Markdown requirements

Use for small repos or early-stage projects.

Create `docs/requirements.md` with current accepted requirements and an operations table:

```markdown
# Requirements

## System

This file is the canonical source for current accepted requirements.

## Required Operations

| Operation | How to do it |
|-----------|--------------|
| Find current requirements | Read this file |
| List actors/personas | Read `## Actors / Personas` |
| List use cases | Read `## Use Cases` |
| List workflows/scenarios | Read `## Workflows / Scenarios` |
| List functional requirements | Read `## Functional Requirements` |
| List non-functional requirements | Read `## Non-Functional Requirements` |
| List operational requirements | Read `## Operational Requirements` |
| Assign ID | Find highest existing prefix and use next number |
| Cite requirement | Use IDs such as `FR-001`, `NFR-002`, `OPR-003` in briefs, plans, worklogs, reviews, commits, and summaries |
| Cite requirement in tests | Add a test comment or metadata line: `Requirement: FR-001` |
| Apply approved requirement change | Edit this file as part of the approved plan task |
| Retire or replace requirement | Remove/replace the current requirement; record rationale in the approving plan/worklog |
| Validate/query requirements | Use `rg "(ACT|UC|WF|FR|NFR|OPR)-[0-9]{3}" docs/requirements.md` |
| Approval policy | Ask before editing canonical requirements unless explicitly delegated |

## Actors / Personas

| ID | Persona | Goal |
|----|---------|------|
| ACT-001 | Maintainer | Safely change and validate the system |

## Use Cases

| ID | Actor | Use Case |
|----|-------|----------|
| UC-001 | ACT-001 | Validate changes before applying them |

## Workflows / Scenarios

### WF-001 — Run validation before applying changes

- Use case: UC-001
- Actor: ACT-001

Steps:
1. Edit the system.
2. Run documented validation.
3. Review failures.
4. Apply only after validation passes.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001 — Validation command exists

- Type: functional
- Use case: UC-001
- Related workflows: WF-001
- Source: human-request

The repo must provide a documented validation command for common local changes.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001 — Fast validation remains quick

- Type: non-functional
- Scope: UC-001
- Source: human-request

Fast validation should complete within the repo-defined target time.

## Operational Requirements

### OPR-001 — Mutating commands are explicit

- Type: operational
- Scope: global
- Source: human-request

Commands that mutate user/system state must be documented separately from read-only validation commands.
```

Document in AGENTS.md:

```markdown
## Requirements
Requirements system: Markdown
Details: `docs/requirements.md`

Rules:
- Durable current requirements live in `docs/requirements.md`.
- IDs use `ACT-001`, `UC-001`, `WF-001`, `FR-001`, `NFR-001`, and `OPR-001`.
- Tests cite requirements they verify using `Requirement: FR-001`.
- Draft requirement changes live in brief/approach/plan artifacts until approved.
- Canonical requirement edits require human approval unless explicitly delegated.
```

### Option B: Existing requirements tool or CLI

If the repo already has a requirements system, document exact commands for the required hooks in `../../references/requirements.md`: list/show actors, use cases, workflows, requirements, apply approved changes, validate/query, and export reports. Mark every command as read-only or mutating, document auth/access prerequisites, and state which mutating commands require human approval.

### Option C: No separate requirements system

If the repo does not maintain requirements separately, document that explicitly. Do not invent a requirements file just because the process supports one.

## Agent Configuration Guide

When setting up or updating agent models for a repo, use `.pi/settings.json` → `subagents.agentOverrides` — NOT full agent file copies in `.pi/agents/`. This ensures repos automatically get updates when global agent definitions change (new skills, updated prompts, tool changes).

```json
{
  "subagents": {
    "agentOverrides": {
      "worker": { "model": "<model-id>", "thinking": "high" },
      "code-reviewer": { "model": "<model-id>", "thinking": "high" }
    }
  }
}
```

Only override agents where the model should differ from the global default.

Ask the user about:
- Preferred providers (cost constraints, API access)
- Whether they have provider-specific API keys
- Any model preferences based on past experience with this codebase

## Test Level Mapping

When setting up test docs, discover existing commands from:
- `package.json` scripts
- `Makefile` / `Justfile` targets
- `Cargo.toml` / `pyproject.toml` configuration
- CI/CD pipeline definitions (`.github/workflows/`, etc.)
- Existing README or CONTRIBUTING docs

Map discovered commands to the standard levels:

| Standard level | Look for |
|---------------|----------|
| Fast feedback | `test --watch`, `vitest`, test commands with file filter args |
| Type check | `tsc --noEmit`, `typecheck`, `mypy`, `cargo check` |
| Lint | `eslint`, `prettier`, `ruff`, `clippy` |
| Unit tests | `test`, `vitest run`, `pytest`, `cargo test` |
| Integration tests | `test:integration`, `test:e2e` (if tests services) |
| E2E tests | `playwright`, `cypress`, `test:e2e` |
| Build | `build`, `compile`, `cargo build` |
| Full verification | `verify`, `check-all`, or a composite of the above |

## What You MUST NOT Do

- Do not invent test commands (discover them from package.json, Makefile, etc.)
- Do not assume model preferences without asking
- Do not create full agent `.md` files in `.pi/agents/` — use `.pi/settings.json` → `subagents.agentOverrides`
- Do not produce a generic report — reference specific files and paths in THIS repo
- Do not guess at architecture or patterns — report what's there and what's missing
- Do not mark backlog or requirements handling as agent-ready just because headings exist; required operations must be concrete enough to execute
