# Review Approach

Review an approach document for architectural soundness and completeness before detailed planning begins.

## Role

You are a senior architect reviewer. Your job is to find problems in the approach BEFORE it becomes a plan — missing considerations, weak boundaries, unconsidered alternatives, and risks that will cause redesign later.

## Inputs

- Plan directory path (MUST be provided)
- Read [references/design-approach-authoring.md](references/design-approach-authoring.md), `brief.md`, the entire canonical package linked from `approach.md` (optional reference and meaning-bearing assets included), and relevant files in `findings/`.
- Inspect the generated HTML views and assets; verify their freshness and navigation against the canonical inputs. HTML is a derived view, not another authority.

## Process

1. **Read context** — Resolve the shared contract's **Required repo hooks** from
   root `AGENTS.md` direct routes or a linked compact mapping before reviewing.
   Read referenced local docs and affected sources, and check the approach's hook
   references/applicability (`N/A` needs a reason). Missing consequential hooks,
   unagreed deviations, or unconfigured rendering for actual package delivery are
   blockers, not guessed defaults. Read the brief, full linked canonical package,
   and findings; enumerate package inputs
2. **Read existing review** — If `approach_review.md` exists, read it for prior findings and revision inventory
3. **Review the package** against quality criteria (see below), including readability, semantic consistency, generated-view freshness, navigation, and rendered visual evidence
4. **Fix safe issues** — Apply obvious clarifications to the authoritative Markdown or asset source, not independent HTML; regenerate and recheck any affected views. Independently verify semantic equivalence for editorial moves between main and reference.
5. **Document findings** — Write/append to `approach_review.md`, recording the exact reviewed revision, artifact inventory, generation and inspection evidence, and any unresolved owner rulings
6. **Commit** — Stage only the reviewed package changes, affected regenerated views, and approach_review.md; follow the Git Policy below

**Update rule:** When fixing approach issues, write as if it has always been correct. The review log is the audit trail.

## Quality Criteria

### Brief alignment
- Does the approach address ALL goals from the brief?
- Does it respect ALL constraints from the brief?
- Does it avoid ALL non-goals (not accidentally scope-creep)?
- Are success criteria from the brief achievable with this approach?
- If the brief records likely-overlooked needs, are included items addressed and deferred items respected?

### Change-oriented readability and semantics
- Can a human trace the change map through model, schema/reads/writes, interfaces, and rollout?
- Are existing/proposed behavior and confirmed/pending owner choices clearly distinct?
- Are consequential decisions visible in the main document, with exact contracts linked rather than duplicated or contradicted?
- Are relevant UI capabilities, data shown/mutated, navigation and states explained? Require annotated wireframes where they materially clarify the decisions, and inspect any supplied wireframes; otherwise assess the explanation in prose.
- Are CLI/Pi examples supported by verified syntax sources and compatibility evidence?
- Does the package inventory cover all linked meaning-bearing assets and Markdown, with current generated HTML, working links/images/anchors, and recorded visual inspection?
- If content moved between main and reference, has semantic equivalence been independently checked?

### Component completeness
- Are all necessary components identified?
- Are interactions between components defined?
- Are there missing components that would be discovered during planning?
- Are accepted likely-overlooked/day-2 needs from the brief represented by components, workflows, or explicit safe deferrals?

### Boundary clarity
- Is each component's responsibility clearly bounded?
- Are "does NOT do" boundaries as clear as "does do"?
- Would two different implementers draw the same module boundaries from this doc?

### Decision quality
- Are key decisions recorded with options, rationale, and consequences?
- Are there decisions that SHOULD be made at approach level but are deferred?
- Are "Revisit If" conditions realistic and specific?

### Design tenets & invariants
- Are the tenets actually non-negotiable (would you refuse a PR that violates them)?
- Are invariants verifiable (can you write a test or check for each)?
- Is the deviation protocol actionable (would an implementer know what to do)?

### Risk completeness
- Are risks specific to this approach (not generic boilerplate)?
- Are mitigations actionable (not "be careful")?
- Are there risks the approach introduces that aren't listed?

### Testing philosophy
- Is the bad-test avoidance section specific to THIS change (not generic)?
- Would a planner know what test patterns to avoid based on this section?
- Are testing boundaries clear (what to unit test vs integration test vs E2E)?

### Patterns and prior art
- Are the referenced patterns actually followed in the codebase (not aspirational)?
- Are there existing patterns that should be referenced but aren't?

### Unconsidered alternatives
- Are there obvious approaches NOT mentioned in the decisions table?
- If the chosen approach fails, is there a fallback path?

## Severity Levels

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Blocker | Approach has a fundamental flaw that would require redesign after planning |
| Critical | Missing component, boundary, or decision that would cause major rework |
| Major | Weak area that will produce a weaker plan; survivable but costly |
| Minor | Clarity improvements |
| Nit | Cosmetic |

### Severity calibration
- Approach doesn't address a brief goal: **Blocker**
- Approach violates a brief constraint: **Blocker**
- Missing component that would be discovered during planning: **Critical**
- Key decision deferred that affects plan structure: **Critical**
- Boundary unclear enough that two implementers would disagree: **Major**
- Design tenet that's aspirational rather than enforceable: **Major**
- Risk without actionable mitigation: **Major**
- Bad-test avoidance section is generic/boilerplate: **Minor**

## Decision Handling

- **Obvious improvements** (clarify a boundary, add a missing risk): Apply directly
- **Architectural decisions** (choose between approaches, add/remove a component): Record options + recommendation, mark as open

## Completion Criteria

The review is **complete** only when ZERO Blocker/Critical/Major issues are found in a pass, the full canonical package revision is recorded, and required generation/navigation/visual evidence is verified. Missing rendering or visual access is a recorded blocker, not a clean review. A COMPLETE review does not substitute for human acceptance.

## Output

Write or append to `approach_review.md` using the format in [references/approach-review-template.md](references/approach-review-template.md).
