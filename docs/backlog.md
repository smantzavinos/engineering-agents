# Backlog

## System

This file is the canonical backlog for this repo. Record durable follow-up work here instead of leaving it only in chat, ephemeral notes, or plan discussions.

Use this backlog for non-critical work that is accepted but does not belong in the current task. Critical discoveries that affect correctness, safety, scope, or verification are not backlog-only items: raise them immediately so the current plan can be adjusted.

## Required Operations

| Operation | Required contract |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Create item | Add a new item from the template below in the appropriate lifecycle section. |
| Assign stable ID | Give each new item the next unused `TASK-XXXX` identifier and never reuse an old ID. |
| Reference format | Refer to backlog items as `TASK-XXXX` in plans, worklogs, reviews, commits, and chat. |
| Source backlink | Every item must include a `Source:` line that points back to the originating plan, worklog, review, or discussion artifact. |
| List Inbox | Review `## Inbox` for newly accepted work that is not yet prioritized. |
| List Up next | Review `## Up next` for the highest-priority items that are ready to pull soon. |
| Mark Ready | Move an item into `## Ready` when it is clarified enough to execute without more triage. |
| Mark Done | Move an item into `## Done` when the work is finished and the durable record should remain visible. |
| Mark Canceled | Move an item into `## Canceled` when it will not be pursued; keep the ID and reason. |
| Defer / Icebox | Move an item into `## Icebox` when it is intentionally deferred with no near-term execution slot. |
| Mark Blocked | Move an item into `## Blocked` when progress is waiting on another decision, task, or dependency. |
| Critical item policy | If the discovery could change the current task or plan correctness, safety, scope, or verification, stop and raise it immediately instead of quietly adding it to the backlog. |

## Item Template

Use this template for every new item:

```markdown
### TASK-XXXX — Short title
- Status: Inbox
- Summary: One or two sentences describing the work.
- Source: <path, review section, issue, or conversation reference>
- Notes: Optional constraints, links, or acceptance cues.
```

The `TASK-XXXX` placeholder describes the required stable ID format. Replace `XXXX` with the next unused four-digit number.

### TASK-0001 — Upgrade @aliou/pi-guardrails 0.9.5 → 0.15.0
- Status: Ready
- Summary: Bump the held pi-guardrails managed package. Requires handling breaking changes: v0.12.0 split guardrails into three extensions (policy / path-access / permission-gate) and renamed public event-bus events; v0.14.0 migrated `pathAccess.allowedPaths` config from `string[]` to `{ kind, path }[]` (auto-migration `010`). v0.13.1 loosened Pi peer deps (compatible with our 0.80.x runtime).
- Source: Package-update review session (commits 822f83d..80a8d19); changelog https://github.com/aliou/pi-guardrails/releases
- Notes: Verify how `nix/modules/pi/default.nix` loads guardrails (single extension vs the new three-extension layout) and confirm our out-of-store `guardrails.json` (guardrailsConfigPath) auto-migrates cleanly on first launch. Update proof-set.json / version fields; run `./tests/run-tests.sh all`.

### TASK-0002 — Fork-currency audit: retire out-of-date forks where upstream has the fix
- Status: In progress (pi-subagents retired; pi-gitnexus + pi-hooks remain)
- Summary: Three managed git packages point at personal (`smantzavinos/*`) forks that are now well behind their true upstreams. For each, confirm which customizations the fork carries, check whether upstream has since incorporated an equivalent, and either (a) drop the fork and pin the real upstream, or (b) rebase the fork onto current upstream if the customization is still unique.
- Source: Package-update review session; fork/upstream compares via GitHub API (2026-07-13).
- Notes:
  - **pi-subagents** → upstream `nicobailon/pi-subagents` (fork 2 ahead / 232 behind). Custom commits: `feat: apply agentOverrides to user agents (not just builtins)`, `fix: disableBuiltins takes priority over agentOverrides for builtins`. NOTE: the staleness warning comparing our pin to the fork's own `main` is a false positive — evaluate against `nicobailon` upstream instead.
    - **AUDIT VERDICT (2026-07-13): RETIRE.** Both customizations are now native in upstream `src/agents/agents.ts`: `applyCustomAgentOverrides` applies `agentOverrides` to user/project (non-builtin) agents, and `applyBuiltinOverrides` handles `projectBulkDisabled`/`userBulkDisabled` (disableBuiltins) priority. Action: pin a specific current upstream commit; verify our exposed extension/skill/prompt paths still match after the 232-commit restructure; run a real per-repo agentOverrides + disableBuiltins smoke test; update proof-set.json.
    - **DONE (2026-07-13):** Retired — pinned upstream `github:nicobailon/pi-subagents#c940fe20e86d9ba429eebcac809ec79d478ef206` (v0.34.0). Upstream `pi` manifest is identical to the old fork (extensions/skills/prompts paths unchanged), so no module `expose` or `resourceExpectations` changes were needed. Verified the `skills/assess-repo/references/agent-configuration.md` config surface (`subagents.agentOverrides` + `disableBuiltins`, project-beats-user priority, all override fields) is still accurate against upstream's override schema. Updated `proof-set.json` and aligned `tests/spec-fixtures/resource-snapshot.v2.ok.json` (this fix also corrected a latent branch-ref mismatch and the earlier pi-ext bump). NOTE: a real `home-manager switch` smoke test of agentOverrides/disableBuiltins still recommended (the repo's `test-fast` runtime snapshot step is environmentally broken here — bin-only pi package — so runtime verification was not possible locally).
  - **pi-hooks** → upstream `prateekmedia/pi-hooks` (5 ahead / 8 behind). Custom commits: ralph-loop escape-sequence RPC-stdout fix, `execute()` parameter-order fix, auto-detect project-local agents when `agentScope` omitted, `processClosed` vs `proc.killed` SIGKILL fallback, `vscode-languageserver-protocol` import path for v3.18+.
    - **AUDIT VERDICT (2026-07-13): REBASE (keep fork).** Upstreamed/redundant: execute param-order (upstream `fix(ralph-loop): correct execute signature parameter order`) and vscode-lsp import (upstream uses ESM-correct `/node.js`). Still UNIQUE and unmerged: (1) `fix(ralph-loop): handle escape sequence contamination in RPC stdout`, (3) `feat(ralph-loop): auto-detect project-local agents` (`resolveAgentScope`/`"auto"` scope default), (4) `processClosed` SIGKILL fallback. Upstream also carries a change we LACK: `@mariozechner/*` → `@earendil-works/*` namespace migration + lsp-core refactor. Action: rebase our fork onto current upstream keeping commits 1/3/4, dropping 2/5, then re-pin; consider upstreaming 1/3/4 via PR to eventually drop the fork.
  - **pi-gitnexus** → upstream `tintinweb/pi-gitnexus` (1 ahead / 18 behind; disabled by default). Custom commit: `fix: stop MCP child process on session_shutdown to prevent hang`.
    - **AUDIT VERDICT (2026-07-13): RETIRE.** Upstream `src/index.ts` now has the identical handler `pi.on('session_shutdown', () => { mcpClient.stop(); })`. Action: pin a specific current upstream commit; verify exposed paths; update proof-set.json (package is off by default, so low risk).
  - Any fork we drop must keep the pinned-commit + idempotent-install contract (see `nix/AGENTS.md`) and update `tests/fixtures/proof-set.json`.

### TASK-0003 — Fix resource-snapshot.mjs Pi module path resolution through the startup wrapper
- Status: Inbox
- Summary: `tests/scripts/resource-snapshot.mjs` (`buildPiModulePath()`) locates the real `pi-coding-agent` package by resolving `which pi` and walking two directories up to find `lib/node_modules/{@earendil-works,@mariozechner}/pi-coding-agent/dist/index.js`. On hosts where the repo's own `pi` startup wrapper is on `PATH` (see `pi-startup-wrapper-spec.sh` / `pi-launch-wrapper.sh`), `which pi` resolves to the wrapper's Nix store package (which only contains `bin/pi`, no `lib/node_modules`), not the real `pi-coding-agent` package — so the entrypoint lookup fails with "Unable to locate Pi module entrypoint" and `./tests/run-tests.sh all` / the Pi proof-set step cannot run.
- Source: Chat discussion during team-mode wave execution follow-up (2026-07-15); observed running `./tests/run-tests.sh all` after deploying `plans/2026_07_14_team_mode_wave_execution/`. Same root cause independently noted in TASK-0002's pi-subagents entry ("the repo's `test-fast` runtime snapshot step is environmentally broken here — bin-only pi package").
- Notes: Root cause confirmed locally: `which pi` → `/home/spiros/.nix-profile/bin/pi` → realpath → `/nix/store/<hash>-pi/bin/pi`, a wrapper script that `export`s `PI_WRAPPER_REAL_PI_BIN=/nix/store/<hash>-pi-0.80.6/bin/pi` and execs `pi-launch-wrapper.sh`. The real package (with the expected `lib/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/` layout) lives under that `PI_WRAPPER_REAL_PI_BIN` path, one level further down. Fix should make `buildPiModulePath()` detect and unwrap the startup wrapper (e.g. read `PI_WRAPPER_REAL_PI_BIN` out of the wrapper script, or exec `pi` with an env-dump escape hatch) before falling back to the current two-levels-up heuristic, so proof-set verification works both with and without the wrapper enabled. Not caused by and unrelated to the team-mode wave execution work; that feature's own verification (fast suite + flake eval, including explicit "skill installed" checks for the new skills) is fully green.

### TASK-0004 — Un-pin llmAgents input once upstream Copilot Enterprise compaction fix lands
- Status: Blocked
- Summary: `flake.nix` pins the `llmAgents` input to `github:numtide/llm-agents.nix/70ff0e7f69a5fe712d675ac29b484e91e98daff0` (pi **0.80.7**), rolling back from latest (pi 0.80.10) because pi >=0.80.8 broke `/compact` and auto-compaction for GitHub Copilot Enterprise accounts (`Error: Compaction failed: Turn prefix summarization failed: 421 Misdirected Request`). Root cause: the 0.80.8 "Unified model runtime and provider authentication" (`ModelRuntime`) refactor stopped threading the resolved Enterprise base URL into the compaction/summarization call path, so it falls back to the individual-account Copilot endpoint and gets rejected.
- Source: Chat discussion diagnosing Atlas-worktree2 compaction failures (2026-07-20); upstream bug https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6768.
- Notes: A community fix exists but is unmerged as of 2026-07-20: https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/compare/main...Marvae:fix/copilot-summarization-base-url. To un-pin: watch https://github.com/numtide/llm-agents.nix/commits/main/packages/pi/hashes.json for a bump to a pi version where #6768 is closed, then in `flake.nix` restore `url = "github:numtide/llm-agents.nix";` and run `nix flake lock --update-input llmAgents`. Re-verify `pi --version` and test `/compact` on a Copilot Enterprise session before considering this done.
