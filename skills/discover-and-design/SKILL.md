description: Document an already-discussed piece of work into an accepted brief.md plus approach.md. Use when the problem, scope, and design direction were already talked through in detail and what remains is writing it down, checking for genuinely overlooked gaps, and asking only targeted clarifying questions. For simple obvious tasks use Discover and Design Simple. To start from a vague idea use Discovery then Design.

# Discover and Design

Turn an already-aligned discussion into an accepted `brief.md` and
`approach.md`. The prior conversation is the source of truth: you document it,
verify the few claims that matter against the codebase, and surface gaps the
discussion genuinely missed. You do not restart the interview, and you do not
run a research program.

## When to use / when to stop

**Use when:** the human has already talked through the problem in detail —
goals, scope, and design direction are effectively agreed — and what remains
is to write it down, check for overlooked areas, and resolve a small number of
targeted questions.

**Stop and redirect when:**

- the task is small and obvious — use `/discover-and-design-simple`
- the direction is not actually agreed, or two or more designs are still live —
  use `/discovery` then `/design`
- the work turns out to be epic-sized — use `/design` (epic decomposition is
  required there)
- verification contradicts a load-bearing assumption from the discussion —
  that is a real design fork, not a documentation detail; say so and redirect
  to `/design`

## Process

1. **Mine the conversation, don't restart it.** Extract from the discussion:
   goals, non-goals, constraints, success criteria, decisions already made
   (with the rationale that was given), and open points. Present a compact
   restatement — "here is what we agreed" — not a question checklist. Ask only
   about contradictions or true blanks, and batch every remaining question
   into a single round. If the context arrived as a handoff summary rather
   than a live conversation and key parts are missing, ask for them instead of
   guessing.
2. **Verify only what matters.** Check the discussion's load-bearing claims
   against the actual code: the files and modules it names, the integration
   points and behavior it assumes. A few file reads in this session is usually
   enough; at most one focused research delegate:

{{delegate:research skill=research}}
Verify [specific claim from the discussion] against [specific files/modules]. Write findings to [path/findings/current_state.md]. Keep it short and evidence-based.
{{/delegate}}

   Do not run a broad topic-by-topic research program — that is what the full
   Design phase is for.
3. **Run a focused gap scan.** Even a thorough discussion misses things. Check
   for legitimately overlooked areas — lifecycle, failure recovery, day-2
   operations, validation and safety, compatibility, requirement gaps — and
   raise only the ones that would change the design or are required for a
   complete, safe v1. Ask at most one focused batch of questions about them.
   Record the scan outcome in the brief (goals, non-goals, or open questions)
   so planning can see what was considered. Everything else goes to open
   questions or, with the human's confirmation, the backlog — not into scope.
4. **Write both artifacts** into the plan directory (ask for the path if
   missing). Use the templates in
   [references/brief-template.md](references/brief-template.md) and
   [references/approach-template.md](references/approach-template.md). Record
   plan level. Fill the decisions tables from the conversation — each decision
   records what was chosen and the rationale as discussed, not new options you
   invented. If the repo maintains requirements, cite IDs or list questions;
   do not edit canonical requirements.
5. **Run one approach review pass** unless the human waives it:

{{delegate:approachReview skill=review-approach}}
Review the approach at [plan directory path]/approach.md for architectural soundness and brief alignment.
{{/delegate}}

   Fix what it finds in one pass. If review exposes a real design fork the
   discussion never settled, stop — that work belongs in the full Design
   phase.
6. **Show the paths and wait.** Do not commit until the human accepts both
   files. Then commit `brief.md`, `approach.md`, `approach_review.md` (if
   any), `findings/` (if any), and `state.json` as
   `design: document agreed approach for <slug>`.
7. **Next step:** "{{note:design-execute-standard}}"

## Quality bar

- The artifacts faithfully record what was agreed — no silent scope additions,
  no dropped constraints, no reopened decisions presented as settled.
- Every load-bearing claim about the codebase was either verified or is marked
  as an open question.
- Gaps raised are ones that change the design or are required for a safe v1 —
  not a generic checklist dump.
- Goals, non-goals, and success criteria are explicit. The approach names the
  files/modules that change and what stays the same.
- No task list, no `tasks.json`, no implementation.

## What you must not do

- Do not re-run the Socratic interview — the discussion already happened.
- Do not implement.
- Do not write `plan.md` or `tasks.json`.
- Do not reopen settled decisions unless verification shows one is wrong — and
  then say so explicitly.
- Do not skip the human accept-and-commit gate.
