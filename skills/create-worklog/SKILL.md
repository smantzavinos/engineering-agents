description: Create a worklog.md execution log from a reviewed plan. The worklog serves as the single entry point for each implementation iteration — read it first, do one task, update it, advance. Use after plan review passes.

# Create Worklog

Create an execution worklog from a reviewed plan.

## Role

You produce the durable execution tracking document that implementation sub-agents will use to know what to do next.

## Inputs

- Plan directory path
- Read: `plan.md` (for task list and verification commands)
- Read: Repo test architecture docs (for exact verification commands if plan references them)
- Read: Repo task-tracking/backlog docs if available (for follow-up capture policy)
- Read: Repo requirements docs if available and the plan cites or updates requirements

## Process

1. **Read plan.md** — Extract task list, verification commands, gate policies
2. **Read repo test docs** — Get exact commands (referenced in AGENTS.md / test architecture docs)
3. **Read repo task-tracking docs** — Get backlog store, stable ID format, default capture status, and critical-item policy if documented
4. **Read repo requirements docs** — If the plan cites or updates requirements, capture the requirements store, ID/reference format, test citation format, approval source, and apply-approved-change procedure
5. **Baseline gate audit** — If the plan includes a Baseline Gate Audit section, carry its results into the worklog. If no baseline audit has been done yet, the worklog must instruct the implementer to run all gates before T1 and record results.
6. **Write worklog.md** — Using the template in [references/worklog-template.md](references/worklog-template.md)
7. **Update state.json** — Set `{ "phase": "ready", "status": "active" }`

## Quality Rules

### Verification commands must be exact
Copy exact commands from plan.md or repo docs. Do NOT invent commands.

### The worklog must be self-sufficient
An implementation sub-agent should be able to read ONLY the worklog and know:
- What task to do next
- What verification commands to run
- What the completion criteria are
- Where to find the plan for detailed instructions

### Task list must match plan exactly
Extract tasks from plan.md in order. Don't reword, reorder, or add tasks.

### Prerequisites must be documented
The worklog must include environment setup needed before implementation:
- Required services (db, redis, docker) with start/stop commands
- Required env vars (names only, no secrets)
- Runtime versions
- How to start/stop services

Get this from repo docs or ask the user.

### Gate policy must be explicit
The worklog must state the plan's chosen unrelated failure policy (`block-on-global-gate` | `allow-scoped-completion` | `split-follow-up`) and include instructions for what the implementer should do if a broader gate fails for reasons unrelated to their task.

### Gate rationale must be explained
The worklog must include a brief note explaining what the task completion gate catches that fast-feedback commands miss (e.g., type mismatches between packages, missing exports, interface drift, cross-module integration issues). This teaches the implementer WHY the gate matters.

### Backlog capture policy must be explicit
The worklog must tell implementers how to handle follow-up work discovered during execution:
- Where the repo backlog lives, or that no backlog mechanism is documented
- How to create accepted follow-up items
- What stable ID/reference format to write back into the worklog
- Default destination for non-critical follow-ups (usually `Inbox`)
- What to do for critical or current-plan-affecting discoveries

If no repo task-tracking mechanism is documented, write that explicitly and instruct implementers to ask before trying to capture follow-up items.

### Requirement change policy must be explicit when relevant
If the plan cites or updates requirements, the worklog must tell implementers:
- Where canonical requirements live
- Which requirement updates are approved by the plan
- How to apply approved requirement edits
- What requirement IDs/reference format to record in the worklog
- What test citation format to use when tasks cite requirement IDs
- What to do if execution reveals a missing, unclear, or conflicting requirement

If no repo requirements mechanism is documented, write that explicitly and instruct implementers to ask before editing canonical requirements.

## Output

Write `worklog.md` in the plan directory. The worklog is designed for one-task-per-sub-agent-call execution.

## What You MUST NOT Do

- Do not implement code
- Do not modify source files
- Do not invent verification commands
- Do not reorder or reinterpret plan tasks
