# Engineering Agents

A structured process for using AI coding agents to design and implement software features, bug fixes, and large initiatives with minimal human interaction. Includes everything you need: process documentation, skills, agent definitions, and a Nix Flake for installing [Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) and [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode).

## Philosophy

Three components work together to produce effective autonomous AI development:

1. **Repository setup** — The right information in the right places, discoverable at the right time
2. **Skills** — Reusable process definitions that tell agents what to do at each stage
3. **Agent modes** — Three distinct agents drive the process at different phases:
   - **Discovery** — Socratic dialogue to clarify intent and determine direction (high human interaction)
   - **Design** — Collaborative research and approach development with delegated sub-agents (medium interaction)
   - **Execution** — Autonomous implementation from approach to completion (minimal interaction)

The key insight: you don't need a complex extension or state machine to orchestrate multi-step development workflows. Capable LLMs in the right mode can drive each phase of the process.

## Quick Start

### 1. Add to your Nix Flake

```nix
# flake.nix
inputs = {
  engineering-agents.url = "github:<your-username>/engineering-agents";
};
```

### 2. Import the Home Manager modules

```nix
# In your home-manager config:
imports = [
  engineering-agents.homeManagerModules.default
];

engineering-agents.pi.enable = true;
engineering-agents.opencode.enable = true;
```

### 3. Apply

```bash
home-manager switch --flake .#<hostname>
```

### 4. Authenticate

```bash
# Pi: run /login inside pi once per machine
pi
/login

# OpenCode: run auth login once per machine
opencode auth login
```

### 5. Inspect managed package freshness

If Pi warns that managed packages/plugins need attention, run `check-updates --dry-run` to inspect what is stale, then apply your configuration with `home-manager switch --flake .#<hostname>`.

Direct cloned installs such as `agent-kit` and `visual-explainer` are outside this startup-warning scope.

### 6. Test Pi changes from this checkout

Use the repo-local development sandbox to test uncommitted Pi module, package, skill, and extension changes without pushing or switching your active Home Manager generation:

```bash
# Build/activate into .pi-dev/ and launch Pi.
./scripts/pi-dev.sh

# Copy existing Pi credentials into the sandbox, then launch.
./scripts/pi-dev.sh --copy-auth

# Activate the sandbox and run the live proof-set against it.
./scripts/pi-dev.sh --verify

# Delete the sandbox, including its copied credentials and sessions.
./scripts/pi-dev.sh --reset
```

The sandbox uses `.pi-dev/home` as `HOME` and never modifies `~/.pi`. `--copy-auth` copies `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`; it does not symlink or modify the source credential file. `.pi-dev/` is ignored by Git.

### Agent Definitions (`agents/`)

8 specialized agents for different tasks and model tiers:

## Workflows

| Workflow | When to use | Process |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Feature Development | New capabilities, maximum rigor | brief → research → approach → plan → review → execute → code review → PR review |
| Bug Fix | Defects, regressions | brief → debug/research → approach → planning → execute → review |
| Epic | Large initiatives | brief → findings → approach → epic decomposition → child plans |
| Simple Change | Trivial fixes, config | brief → implement → verify |

## Usage with Pi

```bash
# Start a Discovery session
pi
/preset discovery

# Start a Design session
/preset design

# Start Execution
/preset execute
# Then: "Execute the plan at plans/my_feature/. Auto-continue."
```

## Usage with Hermes

Hermes agents reference this repo directly (no rendered copies): point the
agent at the repo and route it to `docs/hermes/README.md` — the skill
reference map there covers the full pipeline including PR babysitting
(`skills/babysit-pr/SKILL.md`).

## Usage without Nix

Canonical skills in `skills/` are harness-neutral templates. The final per-harness skill files are generated into `dist/skills/<harness>/` by the renderer (`node tools/render-skills.mjs --write`). See [Skill Rendering](docs/skill-rendering.md) for the pipeline. The `agents/` and `docs/` directories are plain Markdown/JSON.

You can copy the generated trees to any coding agent's configuration directory:

- **Pi**: Copy `dist/skills/pi/*` to `~/.pi/agent/skills/`, agents from `agents/` to `~/.pi/agent/agents/`
- **OpenCode**: Copy `dist/skills/opencode/*` to `~/.config/opencode/skills/`
- **Claude Code**: Reference rendered skill files from `.claude/` configuration

> In OpenCode, the review and read-only-escalation roles are delegated via task categories rather than dedicated subagents — see [Skill Rendering](docs/skill-rendering.md).

## Core Principles

- **Deliberate stages over speed** — Each stage exists because skipping it produces worse results
- **Skills define process, repos define specifics** — Skills know *what* to do; repos define *how*
- **Documentation drives discovery** — AGENTS.md files enable progressive information discovery
- **Everything in one directory** — One plan directory = one unit of work
- **Commits are process checkpoints** — every task ends with exactly one atomic commit
  (`task(T<N>): <desc>`) including source, tests, and the worklog update
- **Tests define contracts early** — test-first discipline per the task's verification class;
  a failing test exists before implementation for `contract` tasks
